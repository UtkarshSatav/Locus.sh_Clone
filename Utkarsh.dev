hi My name is Utkarsh and this project was an assignment given to to my friend here kishan and i helped him in css and js as i was better than him 

in this project the main dificulty that i faced was the dropdown which had so many nested dropdowns and then there was the navbar that would change colors on scrolling it was even more work 
  but in the end it was fun to get out of the comfort zone and make something that would really take time and efford to build, that's what gives me satisfaction in life.
